# NNNewVideo Tracker
[GitHub](https://github.com/Patrosi73/nnnewvideo-tracker) | [Discord](https://discord.gg/ishowspeed)

Quickly and **un**reliably detects new videos on YouTube channels, reporting to a [Discord channel](https://discord.com/channels/800906094729101353/1248181650173464647), and not archiving the original videos (i think i actually disabled it). Current features:
- Total garbage
- Total garbage
- Detect when videos are uploaded
- Track videos across multiple channels (if i haven't broken the code that does this lmao)
- Total garbage
- Report changes in a oh-so-fancy Discord embed
- Update every 1 minute

This is the tracker that [is in use on IShowSpeed's discord (#stream-noti under the clipping category)](https://discord.gg/ishowspeed)! :(
