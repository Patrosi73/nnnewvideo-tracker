# TTTakedown Tracker
> View the feed on the [dedicated Discord server](https://discord.gg/VhsUBKyvwT).

Automaticially detects when SSSniperWolf takes down a clip or video, reporting to a [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/VhsUBKyvwT).

The `data` folder has a JSON file for each of SSSniperWolf's videos, updated every 3 hours by GitHub Actions. When a video is published or deleted or the title or length changes, a clean embed is posted to a Discord webhook.

DM me on Discord ([`jerbear4328`](https://discord.gg/2GR9UFsyBk)) if you want me to add your channel to the bot. :D
